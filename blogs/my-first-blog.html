          Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
          Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they
          live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large
          language ocean. A small river named <span>Duden </span>flows by their
          place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
          paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into
          your mouth.

          Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it
          is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
          text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far
          <span>World of Grammar</span>. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so,
          because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and
          devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed
          her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on
          the way.

          headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line
          Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she

          The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it
          would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was
          left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text
          should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing
          the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
          few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and
          Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for
          their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then
          they are still using her.
